# 🧠 Deep Learning Projects Hub

Welcome to my central hub of deep learning explorations and hands-on projects. This repository links together my work across various subfields of deep learning — from foundational models in PyTorch to FastAI experiments and computer vision applications.

## 🌐 Repository Overview

This repo is organized into key areas of focus. Each sub-repo explores deep learning techniques, coursework and applications with curated code, insights, and tutorials.

### 📦 1. [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://github.com/VinodAnbalagan/Deep_Learning/tree/0cc90863d8dd7f600c91725f60bc3f81856d691f/Deep%20Learning%20with%20Pytorch)
A series of beginner-to-intermediate projects covering core deep learning concepts:
- Building neural networks from scratch
- Custom training loops
- Loss functions and optimizers
- Hands-on with MNIST, CIFAR, and more

### 📘 2. [FastAI - Deep Learning for Coders](https://github.com/VinodAnbalagan/Deep_Learning/tree/0cc90863d8dd7f600c91725f60bc3f81856d691f/FastAI_Deep%20Learning%20for%20Coders)
Projects based on the brilliant FastAI course/book:
- Currently includes:
  - Image classification on Pet Dataset
  - Fine-tuned ResNet models on curated datasets
- More projects in progress

### 🧭 3. [Computer Vision Projects]()
End-to-end CV projects with a storytelling angle and real-world relevance:
- [✔️] MNIST Digit Recognition (PyTorch + Gradio UI + Noise Test + W&B logging)
- [✔️] YOLO
- [🔜] 3D Spatial Intelligence projects (Gaussian Splatting, NeRFs, etc.)


## ✨ Why This Exists
This hub documents my learning journey as I transition toward applied AI/ML research, with a strong focus on:
- 3D AI & Perception
- Vision-based Robotics
- Generative Models for Visual Understanding

My goal is to build impactful, deployable tools that merge creativity with deep technical understanding.


## 📌 Roadmap Highlights
